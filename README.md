# NASSCOM_VSD_VLSI_Soc_design
NASSCOM-PD 23Apr-6May_2025

Welcome to documentation for the VSD-IAT workshop on VLSI SoC design! This repository contains my daily learnings, notes, and hands-on work throughout the course.

This workshop focuses on Open-Source ASIC Physical Design Flow, using tools like OpenLane, Magic VLSI, and the Sky130 PDK. Goal is to get skills in chip design using free and open-source tools. My personal goal is not to become a chip-designer, i want have a good understanding how process is whorking, litte bit of physics and good understaning of the tolls which are involved in the process.

## it not finished and current work in progress!!!!

# Day 1 - Introduction & Synthesis
<details>
<summary> Introduction & Synthesis </summary>

- Familiarization with OpenLane / Sky130
- Physical Design (PnR) stages
- Design Preparation stage
