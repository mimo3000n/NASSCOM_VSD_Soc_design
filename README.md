NASSCOM-PD 23Apr-6May_2025

Welcome to documentation for the VSD-IAT workshop on VLSI SoC design! This repository contains my daily learnings, notes, and hands-on work throughout the course.

This workshop focuses on Open-Source ASIC Physical Design Flow, using tools like OpenLane, Magic VLSI, and the Sky130 PDK. Goal is to get skills in chip design using free and open-source tools. My personal goal is not to become a chip-designer, i want have a good understanding how process is whorking, litte bit of physics and good understaning of the tolls which are involved in the process.

## it not finished and current work in progress!!!!

### What is OpenLANE

[OpenLANE](https://github.com/efabless/openlane) is an automated RTL to GDSII flow which includes various open-source components such as OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Fault, Netgen, SPEF-Extractor. It also facilitates to add custom design exploration and optimization scripts. The detailed diagram of the OpenLANE architecture is shown below:
